The goal of this project is to build an image classification model capable of identifying different types of leaves using deep learning. This code was designed for use in an autonomous greenhouse to predict the type of plant currently in the chassis. This project can also be applied to various fields, including botany, agriculture, and environmental science.

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the type of leaf from an input image. Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, the model is trained on a labeled image dataset to recognize and predict different leaf species based on visual features.
