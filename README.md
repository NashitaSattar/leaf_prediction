# Leaf Prediction CNN Model
The goal of this project is to build an image classification model capable of identifying different types of leaves using deep learning. This code was designed for use in an autonomous greenhouse to predict the type of plant currently in the chassis. This project can also be applied to various fields, including botany, agriculture, and environmental science.

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the type of leaf from an image. All images are preprocessed to black and white (grayscale) to focus the model on shape rather than color. Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, the model is trained on a labeled dataset of leaf images to predict different species.
